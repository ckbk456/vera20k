# Native comparison workflow

For original byte reads, disassembly and whole-code scans, use the indexed
[native inspection tool](native_inspect.md). It shares this runner's executable
identity and PE owner; static inspection is separate from checked execution.

Native comparison guidance; adapt as useful and distinguish findings from hypotheses.

Use original `gamemd.exe` instructions to produce reference outputs, then compare
the Rust function used by the engine against them. The shared Python runner handles
executable identity, bounded execution, fresh function-call state, diagnostics, and
reference-file checks. It does not establish that a chosen function or fixture
represents the game's active path.

### Capstone

Static inspection uses Capstone **5.0.7**, pinned in `tools/requirements-test.txt`.
Install those dependencies for the [shared inspection CLI](native_inspect.md) and
its portable tests. Mechanism-specific runtime-memory consumers retain their own
interpretation; a static file scan does not observe initialized memory.

## Run an existing comparison

From the repository root, with Python 3.10+ and Unicorn **2.1.4** installed:

```powershell
python -m pip install unicorn==2.1.4
$env:VERA20K_GAMEMD_EXE = 'C:/your-retail-install/gamemd.exe'
python -m tools.color_oracle.hsv_to_rgb
cargo test -p vera20k --lib rules::color_scheme::tests::hsv_to_rgb_matches_native_oracle_all_hues_at_sv_boundaries
```

`RA2_DIR` is an alternative; an explicit executable path takes precedence and never
silently falls back. The loader hashes the same immutable bytes it maps. Default
loading accepts only the retail executable with SHA-256
`1cdd1180e49024fbda8ad568caac2e86e856063ff67ab38f62b7d2c7bb84298c`
is accepted, including under optimized Python. No executable is distributed here.

Both halves matter: the Python command checks current native output against the
reference; the Rust test checks production conversion against that reference.
Python success alone does not show Rust parity. Normal Rust tests use committed
outputs and do not require Unicorn or an executable. Follow `AGENTS.md` before Cargo.

[Schema, native boundaries and reproduction](spatial_oracle/harvest_attack_return.md) | `world/harvest_attack_return_oracle_tests.rs`; production `world/harvest_field_cycle_tests.rs` command/combat integration. Native corpus checks and Rust replay validation are separate claims. |
| `tools.spatial_oracle.time_to_build` | 332 original `TechnoClass::Time_To_Build` (`0x6F47A0`) totals on fixture objects: costs and BuildTimeMultipliers per class, BuildSpeeds (including percent-only doubles), country multipliers (including the defense slot), power ratios and low-power clamps, factory counts x MultipleFactory, walls, and the retail test world's MTNK, FV and E1 | `sim/production/factory.rs` `time_to_build_matches_the_native_oracle`; which objects reach it, the rate division and the cadence are out of scope |
| `tools.spatial_oracle.factory_cadence` | The original build start `0x4C9EA0` (Ghidra `FactoryClass__SetRate`) for 14 Time_To_Build values across both rate clamps, and 10 whole builds under `FactoryClass::AI` (`0x4C9B20`) once per frame with the real Available_Money/Spend_Money: every step attempt, holds for want of money, a deposit retry and completion | `sim/production/factory.rs` `start_rate_matches_the_native_start` / `step_all_matches_the_native_cadence`; `production_replay_tests.rs` `retail_builds_step_at_the_native_frames` (retail MTNK, FV, E1 through `advance_tick`). What starts, suspends or resumes a factory and later rate rewrites are out of scope |
| `tools.spatial_oracle.group_spread_gates` | 524 target/candidate Cell pairs through two slices of the original group spread `0x0064CDA0`: the target height (`0x0064D296..0x0064D2E2`, with both real `0x005657A0` lookups) and the reservation/height-band exits from `0x0064D53D`; signed levels, flag `0x100` on either Cell, `0x8000`, and every other flag bit set. The zone compare, Can_Enter_Cell and the distributor are not executed | `world/group_spread_gate_tests.rs` compares `spread_height` and `within_spread_band` on production terrain cells |

Run them as modules (`python -m ...`). Imports do not emulate or write files;
`--help` works without retail configuration. `--output <path>` selects another
reference. A missing reference or mismatch fails; checking never creates or fixes it.
`--write` explicitly replaces the payload and its `.meta.json` sidecar. Review any
changed values against native evidence before accepting them. This is not a way to
make failing Rust tests green.

The NULL boundary corpus preserves the ordinary `track_destination` corpus. Run
`python -m tools.spatial_oracle.track_destination --null-boundary --check` to replay
it. Aircraft `0x41AA80(NULL,flag)` jumps straight to Foot `0x4D94B0`; Foot clears
NavComAux at `0x4D94C7`, clears NavCom at `0x4D9510`, and calls the active locomotor's
Stop at `0x4D96B9` unless its Aircraft/current-or-queued-Attack/live-target gate
skips it. After a Stop, `0x4D96BC` clears a re-target's NavCom again. Both paths reach
the timer tail `0x4D96C2..0x4D9707`: blocked false, blockage timer started from
Rules `+0x1768`, and movement timer started with duration zero, preserving retries.
The corpus observes each boundary and executes the timer writes, including frame
and signed-duration extremes. Its paired original Drive/Ship is intentionally a
supplied locomotor boundary: it does not establish Aircraft Fly Stop parity.
Fly `0x4CCFD0` re-enters the class setter through airfield `0x41A160` or landing-cell
`0x418E20` selection, whose docking, occupancy and Scenario RNG effects require
their own complete mechanism. Jumpjet Stop `0x54B4D0` reads owner location
(`0x54B53E..0x54B583`) and searches from that cell; it does not read old NavCom.
Accepted Jumpjet touchdown clears its locomotor destination/moving byte before
PerCell (`0x54C8CB..0x54C8F0`), then calls the class NULL setter unconditionally
(`0x54C8FF`). The original instruction packet is
`spatial_oracle/track_destination_touchdown_control.json`; reproduce it with
`python -m tools.native_inspect disasm 0x54C8CB --bytes 58`.
The no-target production regression is in `world/per_cell_object_turn_tests.rs`;
the shared NULL corpus provides the timer arithmetic comparison.

Sidecars identify the executable, Unicorn Python binding and native core versions,
entries, fixture assumptions, substitutions, coverage, and canonical payload hash.
Metadata changes fail checks even if outputs match, prompting review of the changed
environment. Existing references without sidecars remain checkable, with an explicit
message that their historical environment is unknown. Regeneration can record the
current environment; it cannot recover historical provenance.

## Add a comparison

Start with `tools/color_oracle/hsv_to_rgb.py` for a complete example. Establish the
body, active callers, calling convention, input/state ownership, and observable
outputs before constructing the fixture. Select cases that exercise meaningful
branches and boundaries. Avoid a second Python implementation of the algorithm.

* `call(address, ecx=..., stack_args=[...], writes={...}, dumps={...})` maps verified
  code in a fresh emulator for each invocation. Entries must lie in an original
  executable section; fixture writes cannot replace native instructions. Carry only
  the native state your comparison deliberately preserves between calls.
* For an interior block, use `load_image(uc)` and `run_checked(uc, begin, end)` after
  establishing its live registers, memory and x87 state. Multiple legitimate stop
  boundaries can be a tuple. This low-level API supports custom fixtures; it cannot
  certify their initialization or detect every patch a caller makes.
* Declare necessary intermediate addresses with `required_addresses=[...]` when
  reaching an endpoint alone could conceal a bypass. They record instruction-hook
  visits, not proof of instruction effects or of full path equivalence. Endpoints
  stop **before** executing their instruction and cannot be required addresses.
* Use `finish_vectors(generate, path, provenance=lambda: provenance(...))`. Lazy
  callables keep help and argument errors independent of native work. Record the
  scope, assumptions, substitutions (including none), and native entries explicitly.
  Pass `source_paths={label: Path(...)}` when recording source provenance: the
  shared publisher captures UTF-8/LF hashes before generation, rejects drift
  through metadata construction before comparison/publication, and owns the
  `source_normalized_lf_sha256` field. List the producer and its relevant helpers;
  this is a run consistency check, not a source lock or an import-time attestation.
* Consume native outputs in a focused Rust test of the actual production function.
  Assert case identity/coverage as well as output equality, and review the connection
  to callers independently. The HSV example checks 2,304 inputs, not all 256³ inputs
  or final rendered colors.

## Investigating a failed native run

`run_checked` raises `NativeExecutionError` (an `OracleError`) on unsuccessful
execution. Its `diagnostics` dictionary preserves the immediate Unicorn timeout
flag, observed instruction count/budget, entry and expected endpoints, last 16
observed instruction addresses, required/missing visits, and entry/failure
registers. Each register snapshot includes FPCW and up to 16 readable words at
ESP; unmapped or partially readable stacks are reported without masking the
original failure.

The reason distinguishes `timeout`, `fault`, `early_stop`,
`instruction_limit_reached` and `required_addresses_missing`. The instruction
count is hook observations, not a retirement counter. Reaching the budget does
not rule out an external stop on that same instruction; a timeout flag does not
explain why the operation was slow. Reports diagnose a rejected run, never prove
native output or a complete initialized game state.

Set a directory to save each failure as a new JSON file, including failures in
older generators that call `run_checked` before `finish_vectors`:

```sh
VERA20K_NATIVE_FAILURE_DIR=/absolute/diagnostics python -m tools.color_oracle.hsv_to_rgb --check
```

In PowerShell, set `$env:VERA20K_NATIVE_FAILURE_DIR = 'C:/diagnostics'` first.
Success writes nothing. The directory is created when needed; unique files use
exclusive creation and do not replace earlier failures or golden files. The
exception names its `report_path`. A failure to write diagnostics is reported
alongside the original native failure. Without the environment variable, the
structured diagnostics remain on the exception and no report file is written.

Custom fixture owners should name the case and relevant supplied inputs:

```python
run_checked(machine, entry, stop, context={
    "case": "unfunded-repair",
    "inputs": {"seed": seed, "frame": frame, "credits": 0},
})
```

Context must be a JSON object and is frozen before execution. `call` accepts the
same argument and adds a reserved `call` object containing ECX/EDX, stack
arguments, FPCW, observation mode and fixture write ranges. Reports do not copy
the full heap, pointed-to data or executable and cannot restore an emulator.
Include the fixture selectors needed to reproduce the case. The recorded
`expected_native_sha256` is the runner's expected image, not an attestation of a
custom machine: `run_checked` also accepts synthetic tests.

The shared `Reader.invoke(..., context=...)` forwards this context. Anytown
`Mission.setup` supplies its fixture class, phase/frame, continuation inputs and
the current physical INI layer's name/path/SHA-256 for General and Radiation
Rules reads. A repeated-case driver can call
`fixture.setup(context={"case": "unit-unlimbo", "placement_index": 7})` to add
the precise case selector; `setup` and `rules_layer` are filled by the owner.
Other custom generators must supply their own selectors; registers alone cannot
identify a case whose input data lives behind pointers.

## Execution guarantees and limits

Unicorn can return normally when its instruction or time budget expires. The runner
therefore requires a declared endpoint and rejects timeouts, faults, unexpected
stops, and missing required visits. Failures include recent instruction addresses.
Existing custom exit configuration is disabled so it cannot override those boundaries.
Budgets default to five million instructions and ten seconds; choose a tighter
instruction budget for small leaves. Existing hooks remain the fixture owner's
responsibility. No zero-return or unmapped-memory fallback silently invents an answer.

The loader preserves the legacy broad RWX image mapping and zero-filled BSS. It is
**not a Windows loader**: imports, constructors, TLS, OS services, and runtime global
state are not initialized. A mapped read is not evidence that its value is realistic.
Declare supplied state and hooks; substituted function results validate only the
remaining computation. Whole-game, scheduling, device, and GPU behavior require
additional evidence.

The legacy default x87 control word is `0x0E7F` (53-bit precision, truncation); verify
the appropriate ambient state for each native entry. `capture_st0=True` executes an
external FSTP observation stub and stores **binary64**, not the full 80-bit register.
The stub must finish before a result is returned. Unicorn transcendental instructions
such as FYL2X may differ from physical x87 hardware. Gaussian vectors retain that
caveat; equality is not hardware parity. Floating-point comparisons preserve signed
zero, and native bit dumps remain preferable where precise representation matters.

`tools/rmg_oracle/harness.py` keeps legacy imports working through the verified loader
and checked `call`. Other scripts that directly invoke `emu_start` have **not** all
been migrated. In particular, do not infer completion checking or read-only CLI
behavior for the entire oracle directory from the listed examples.

Run the runner's synthetic failure checks with:

```powershell
python -m tools.run_tests
# Focus only the shared native-runner failure contracts:
python -m unittest tools.test_native_oracle -v
```

These test runner behavior, not retail behavior. The tests cover limits, faults,
premature stops, alternate exits, missing paths, fresh state, FSTP completion,
executable identity, reference preservation, provenance mismatches, and diagnostics.

## Saved-map browser comparisons

The [browser evidence](../docs/research/skirmish-ui/2026-09-12-saved-seed-browser.md)
links three additional bounded comparisons: `tools.storage_oracle.seed_order`
(original qsort and timestamp comparator, 36 cases), `tools.storage_oracle.crt_random`
(supplied TLS seeds, 224 draws), and `tools.storage_oracle.saved_scrollbar`
(original x87 thumb arithmetic, 450 supplied geometries). Each supports `--check`
and explicit `--write` through the common runner and records provenance beside
its JSON payload. None establishes native full-window visual parity or a live
first-save RNG state.

## Explicit bounded image profiles

The default whole-image pin above remains unchanged. The existing loader can
return an immutable `ScopedImage` only when a trusted mechanism supplies an
`ExecutionProfile` with a separately pinned whole SHA, original region hashes,
entry/end pairs, data read/write ranges, fixture-write ranges and sink ABIs.
There is no CLI option or environment variable for arbitrary identity enrollment.
The first profile belongs to the existing
[clock/throttle owner](input_oracle/README.md#authenticated-steam-clockthrottle-qualification),
not a replacement Windows loader or a generic qualification of the Steam game.

`load_image(uc, profile=profile)` binds the handle to that machine. Every scoped
run must pass it to `run_checked(..., image=image, sinks=callbacks)`; an omitted
or mismatched handle fails, and a loader-owned lifetime hook rejects raw
`emu_start` outside a guarded run. Scoped fixture writes use `image.write`, which
rejects executable-section writes and undeclared ranges. Mapped qualified code is
rehashed before and after execution; guest writes to native code fail immediately.
Calling host Unicorn mutation APIs directly is not a supported fixture workflow.

The runner owns code/data guards and dispatches declared sink callbacks before
any sink instruction executes. Callbacks must return to the original stack return
word with their declared argument cleanup; merely allowlisting an address cannot
execute its original body. Endpoints stop before their instruction and cannot be
claimed as executed coverage. Out-of-closure instructions, boundary-straddling
instructions, undeclared data reads/writes and missing/incorrect sink handlers
raise `NativeExecutionError` with `reason=profile_violation`, profile identity,
access details, context, registers and a bounded trace. Existing completion,
budget, timeout and required-address checks still apply. `provenance(image=...)`
records the actual scoped buffer and complete profile; unscoped provenance retains
its historical identity gate.

Synthetic failure tests in `tools/tests/test_native_scope.py` establish these
runner contracts, not retail behavior. Only the mechanism's executable capture
and production consumer checks demonstrate its stated bounded comparisons.
