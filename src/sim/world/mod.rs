//! Game simulation - owns the EntityStore and deterministic tick stepping.
//!
//! The Simulation is the authoritative game state. It spawns entities from
//! map data, executes command envelopes on fixed ticks, advances gameplay
//! systems, and exposes deterministic state hashing for replay/desync checks.
//!
//! Responsibility boundaries:
//! - `command_schedule.rs`: queue admission, due batches, house order and group destinations
//! - `world_commands.rs`: individual payloads and selection/ownership helpers
//! - `world_hash.rs` — deterministic state-hash folds
//! - `world_spawn.rs` — entity spawning from map data and production
//! - `world_orders.rs` — order-intent tick systems (attack-move, guard, area-guard)
//! - `lifecycle.rs` / `substrate.rs` — object transitions, stores and registration order
//! - `object_turn.rs` — complete live-object turn and pass outcomes
//! - `techno_ai.rs` — per-object AI dispatch within each turn
